# Work Samples
I created this repository to share some samples of code I've written in shipped titles. It is not intended to be used for purposes other than reviewal, but if you see something you want to use for your own stuff, go for it.
All the works in my samples are random extractions from a complete full source code. No namespaces, and no library usages are included.

# AI
It contains my approach to a bot (AI) system that uses goal oriented action planning (GOAP). It is part of a bigger system that I've written to simulate human like behavior (bots and taking over disconnecting players) and is available in the shipped mobile title Legends of Catopia.
# Abilities
My extendible implementation for an Ability System in a shipped MOBA game. This is a very small portion of the full structure.
# Azure Functions
Some code samples I wrote for our Azure backend (Azure Functions). This is a random selection from a full azure function setup comprised of 82 functions to manage a title in soft-launch with 100,000 players.
# Gameplay Mechanics
Smaller files that serve specific game features. There's honestly not a specific reason I throw files in this folder other than they're smallish, feel mostly gameplay related, and I feel like it.
# Audio
A quick snippet of some of the code I wrote to manage music in one of the titles.
# Content Management
It will contain some samples of asset management and loading.
