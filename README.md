# MySamples
I created this repository to share some samples of code I've written in shipped titles. It is not intended to be used for purposes other than reviewal, but if you see something you want to use for your own stuff, go for it.
All the works in my samples are random extractions from a complete full source code. No namespaces, and no library usages are included.

# AI
It contains my approach to a bot (AI) system that uses goal oriented action planning (GOAP). It simulates very human like behavior and is available in the shipped mobile title Legends of Catopia.
# Abilities
My extendible implementation for an Ability System in a shipped MOBA game. This is a very small overview of the actual structure.
# Gameplay Mechanics
Smaller files that serve specific game features. There's honestly not a specific reason I throw files in this folder other than they're smallish and I feel like it.
